TODO
====
* insert -> when using an INTEGER PRIMARY KEY, then sqlite will fill it
  automatically with the lastest rowid if no value is specified, maybe adapt
  this also in tinysql
* insertmany -> autoinc fields won't work here, maybe insert rows individually?
* transactions
* select() -> specify return type (return instances, dicts, tuples, etc), and also SQL instead of cls
* documentation


DONE
====
* insert -> fill autoinc fields after writing to database (required for
  subsequent updates). use python sqlite's lastrowid to get the value
* lazy db_enum
* simple conditions for select
* limit and offset select()
* define Binary type that gets mapped to BLOB. also, mark BLOB, ndarray as types
  that might be dumped, while other types won't (TYPE_MAPPING -> ("ndarray",
  True) or similar, to reduce hard-coding types)
* insertmany -> use executemany 
* update from class or dict
* update one particular instance using its PKs
* execute, executemany
