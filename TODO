* documentation


DONE
====
* lazy db_enum
* simple conditions for select
* limit and offset select()
* define Binary type that gets mapped to BLOB. also, mark BLOB, ndarray as types
  that might be dumped, while other types won't (TYPE_MAPPING -> ("ndarray",
  True) or similar, to reduce hard-coding types)
* insertmany -> use executemany 
* update
* execute, executemany
